# Digit-Recognition-MNIST

This repository implements a deep learning program Digit Recognition using MNIST dataset.
This repository contains 3 files. They are:
1. model_training.py
2. DIGIT_MNIST_model.h5
3. pred.ipynb

## model_training.py
  This program does the training part for digit recognition.
  Dataset              :-   MNIST (from tensorflow.keras.datasets)
  Neuron model         :-   CNN (convolutional neural network)
  Activation Function  :-   RELU, softmax
  Epochs               =    10
  Accuracy             =    
  Total Loss           =    

  After running this program, DIGIT_MNIST_model.h5 is generated.

## DIGIT_MNIST_model.h5
  This is the saved model for our digit recognition using MNIST dataset.

## pred.ipynb
